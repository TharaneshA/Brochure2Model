**Brochure2Model** is an innovative web application that transforms static product brochures into dynamic, interactive 3D experiences. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini LLM, it automatically reads a PDF brochure, extracts key marketing features, and intelligently maps them as interactive hotspots onto a corresponding 3D model.

This tool is designed for marketing teams, product managers, and sales professionals to create stunning, web-based product showcases with minimal effort.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (or npm/yarn)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.10 or later)
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. Get yours from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

---

### 1. **Backend Setup** (`/satori_backend`)

First, set up the Python backend server which handles the AI processing.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd satori_backend

# 2. Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Create a .env file from the example
# In this file, add your Gemini API Key
# For example: GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...your...key..."
cp .env.example .env

# 6. Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can view the interactive API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

### 2. **Frontend Setup** (`/frontend`)

Next, set up the Next.js frontend application.

```bash
# 1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# 2. Install dependencies using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# 3. Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

##üí° Usage
Open the application in your browser (http://localhost:3000).

Click "Upload 3D Model (.glb)" and select a .glb or .gltf file.

Click "Upload Brochure (.pdf)" and select the corresponding PDF document.

Once both files are selected, the "Generate Hotspots" button will become active. Click it.

Wait a few moments while the backend processes the PDF and communicates with the Gemini API.

The 3D model will appear with interactive hotspots. Click on a hotspot or an item in the left-hand list to see the AI-generated marketing summary.
